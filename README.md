# Crop Row Detection Implementation with Classsical Computer Vision Methods

  In this repository, I will try to implement an intuition behind a paper named A template-free machine vision-based crop row detection algorithm, which was published in 2021.

One can be reach the paper with this link below:

You can use the implemented code by editing the main.py, TODO places are pointed clearly.

FOR NOW IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT CONSISTS THE EXTENDING OTHER ROW OBJECTS AND EXTRACTING LINES WITH HOUGH TRANSFORM.
